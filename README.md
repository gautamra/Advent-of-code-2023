# Advent-of-code-2023
I use the 2023 Advent of Code challenge to brush up on my C++. I learned how to program with C++ in middle school. That was many many years ago.... I figured it was time to brush it up.

I wonder if I could get away with just diving into it. Figure out how I wanted to solve the problem, and just look up missing syntax and conventions as things come up. I hear the problems get harder with every day. We'll see how long I last.

## Day 1
I've been working pretty much exclusively with Python over the last few years, and its taking a bit of time getting adjusted to the usuals: declaring the variables, putting in the semicolons. I will admit that declaring variables forces me to organize my first draft a bit better. It's hard not to miss Python's simplicity. 

## Day 2
I organized my code a bit better this time, and internalized the general syntax for maps, vectors, arrays etc. Error messages are not very helpful. Segmentation faults are the absolute worst. I realized a bit late that some variables should have been constants. It's likely that I will want to figure out how to set up namespaces shortly.
